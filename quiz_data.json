        "answer": "C) Perform an X-ray of the affected leg, including the joints above and below.",
        "explanation": "Correct. While many minor injuries in toddlers resolve, a limp warrants a basic X-ray to rule out a subtle fracture (like a toddler's fracture of the tibia). It is a low-cost, low-radiation study that provides definitive information and reassurance. CT/MRI are not indicated as first-line tests for this presentation."

        ],
        "answer": "A) Bilateral lateral decubitus views.",
        "explanation": "Correct. On decubitus views, the dependent lung should normally deflate due to gravity. If a foreign body is causing air-trapping, the dependent lung will remain hyperinflated. This is a classic, low-radiation technique for this scenario."

        ],
        "answer": "B) To avoid significant radiation dose to the ovaries in a young patient when a lower-dose alternative can effectively evaluate the pelvic organs.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Protecting the gonads from unnecessary radiation is a key principle, especially in young patients. Since ultrasound provides excellent visualization of the pelvic organs (uterus, ovaries) without any radiation, it is the strongly preferred first-line modality."

        ],
        "answer": "C) An ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Ultrasound can readily detect hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney), which is the key secondary sign of an obstructing stone. It also avoids radiation in a young patient. While a non-contrast CT is more sensitive for the stone itself, ultrasound is an excellent, low-cost, and radiation-free first step."

        ],
        "answer": "C) Observation by the clinical team, with imaging only if symptoms worsen.",
        "explanation": "Correct. In cases of minor head trauma in children without any 'red flag' signs (e.g., loss of consciousness, vomiting, seizure), clinical decision rules recommend observation. The risk from radiation outweighs the very low probability of finding a significant injury requiring intervention."

            "A) The scan should be done to satisfy the family's request and provide legal protection for the hospital.",
            "B) The scan is not clinically justified, and the lifetime cancer risk from radiation outweighs the negligible benefit.",
            "C) A CT with IV contrast should be performed to get more detailed information about the brain.",

        ],
        "answer": "B) The scan is not clinically justified, and the lifetime cancer risk from radiation outweighs the negligible benefit.",
        "explanation": "Correct. This highlights the core principle of justification in medical imaging. Unnecessary radiation exposure, especially in children who are more radiosensitive, must be avoided. The lack of clinical indication means the risk of the scan is greater than its potential benefit."

        ],
        "answer": "B) The cannula is too small for the required injection rate and the location is not ideal for a quality scan.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Angiography (CTA) requires a large-bore cannula (ideally 18G or 20G) in a large antecubital vein to handle the high flow rate of contrast injection (4-6 mL/sec).

        ],
        "answer": "D) An urgent consultation with Interventional Radiology for possible embolization.",
        "explanation": "Correct. For active arterial bleeding from a solid organ (like the spleen or liver) in a hemodynamically stable patient, Interventional Radiology can often perform embolization. This is a minimally invasive procedure where a catheter is guided to the bleeding artery, which is then blocked off, thus stopping the hemorrhage and often avoiding a major open surgery (splenectomy)."

        ],
        "answer": "A) A digital vaginal examination.",
        "explanation": "Correct. In a patient with third-trimester bleeding, a digital or speculum exam must not be performed until a placenta previa (where the placenta covers the cervix) has been definitively ruled out, ideally by ultrasound. Performing an exam in the presence of a previa can disrupt the placenta and cause catastrophic maternal and fetal hemorrhage."

        ],
        "answer": "B) Ultrasound provides superior visualization of the uterus and ovaries without radiation.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Ultrasound is the ideal first-line test for evaluating gynaecological structures. It provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and detail of the uterine endometrium and ovarian follicles, and completely avoids ionizing radiation to the gonads in a young patient. CT is typically reserved as a second-line or problem-solving tool if the ultrasound is inconclusive."

        ],
        "answer": "C) An urgent Doppler Ultrasound of the scrotum.",
        "explanation": "Correct. The primary clinical concern in acute scrotal pain is testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention to save the testicle. Doppler ultrasound is the modality of choice as it is fast, uses no radiation, and can definitively assess blood flow to the testicle. The phrase 'time is testicle' underscores the urgency."

        ],
        "answer": "A) No imaging is required for uncomplicated UTI; treat based on clinical findings.",
        "explanation": "Correct. For a typical, uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in a healthy, non-pregnant patient, imaging is not necessary and constitutes a low-yield use of resources.

        "explanation": "Correct. The 'coffee bean sign' is the characteristic radiographic appearance of a sigmoid volvulus. In this condition, the sigmoid colon twists on its mesentery, creating a large, closed-loop obstruction. The walls of the apposed loops of bowel form a line down the middle, resembling the crease in a coffee bean."

        ],
        "answer": "B) To look for a treatable cause of cognitive decline, such as a chronic subdural hematoma or hydrocephalus.",
        "explanation": "Correct. While a CT scan cannot diagnose a neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's, its crucial role in this context is to identify structural abnormalities. In an elderly patient with a fall, there is a high suspicion for a chronic subdural hematoma (a slow bleed) which can mimic or worsen dementia but is potentially treatable with surgery."

        ],
        "answer": "C) Reassurance and conservative management (e.g., analgesics).",
        "explanation": "Correct. The vast majority of headaches in young, healthy individuals are primary headaches (like tension-type or migraine) and do not require neuroimaging. In the absence of 'red flag' symptoms, performing a CT or MRI is a low-yield use of resources and may lead to incidental findings. A good clinical assessment is key."

        ],
        "answer": "B) A bedside cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram).",
        "explanation": "Correct. In a patient suspected of having a large, hemodynamically significant PE, a bedside echo can rapidly show signs of acute right heart strain (e.g., a dilated right ventricle, paradoxical septal motion). This finding dramatically increases the likelihood of a life-threatening PE and can prompt urgent treatment (e.g., thrombolysis) even before definitive imaging is completed."

        ],
        "answer": "C) 20G (pink) or 18G (green)",
        "explanation": "Correct. A high-quality CTPA requires a rapid injection of a compact bolus of contrast at a flow rate of 4-6 mL/sec to densely opacify the pulmonary arteries. A small cannula (22G or smaller) cannot handle this flow rate, which would result in a non-diagnostic scan and a wasted radiation dose for the patient."

        ],
        "answer": "B) Immobilize the thumb in a spica splint and repeat the X-ray in 10-14 days.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Scaphoid fractures are notoriously difficult to see on initial X-rays. Missing this diagnosis can lead to non-union and long-term wrist problems. The standard, resource-conscious approach is to treat empirically based on clinical suspicion (snuffbox tenderness), immobilize the wrist, and repeat imaging after 10-14 days, by which time bone resorption may make the fracture line visible."

        ],
        "answer": "A) Within the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle.",
        "explanation": "Correct. This is a long-standing radiation protection guideline. The '10-day rule' states that for non-emergency high-dose procedures (like an abdominal/pelvic CT), it is safest to schedule them in the first 10 days following the onset of menstruation. This is the time when the patient is least likely to have an undetected early pregnancy, thus minimizing the risk of irradiating a fetus."

        ],
        "answer": "C) A high-resolution thyroid ultrasound.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Ultrasound is the primary modality for evaluating thyroid nodules. It is inexpensive, uses no radiation, provides excellent anatomical detail, can characterize nodules based on features suspicious for malignancy (e.g., microcalcifications, irregular margins), and can be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy if necessary."

        ],
        "answer": "B) Is there free fluid (i.e., blood) in the peritoneum or pericardium?",
        "explanation": "Correct. The FAST scan is a rapid bedside ultrasound protocol used in the initial assessment of trauma patients. Its primary goal is to detect hemoperitoneum (blood in the abdomen) or pericardial effusion/tamponade (blood around the heart), which can indicate life-threatening internal bleeding requiring urgent surgical intervention."

        "answer": "B) The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle.",
        "explanation": "Correct. ALARA is the cornerstone of radiation safety, particularly in children. It means that every effort must be made to use the lowest possible radiation dose that will still produce images of diagnostic quality.

        "answer": "C) Accurate collimation to the area of interest.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Collimation, which means tightening the X-ray beam to only the specific area being imaged (e.g., the chest), is one of the single most effective ways to reduce the overall radiation dose to the patient.

        ],
        "answer": "A) 'Nil Per Os' - nothing by mouth for at least 4 hours.",
        "explanation": "Correct. NPO is a medical abbreviation for the Latin phrase 'Nil Per Os', which literally means 'nothing by mouth'. This instruction means the patient should not eat or drink anything. This is crucial for many abdominal scans to reduce the risk of aspiration if IV contrast causes nausea, and to ensure an empty stomach for better visualization."

        "explanation": "Correct. A CT scanner acquires data across a huge range of tissue densities. 'Windowing' is the process of adjusting the displayed greyscale (brightness/contrast) on the viewing monitor to optimize the visibility of specific tissues. For example, 'lung windows' make the lung parenchyma clear, while 'bone windows' make the skeleton sharp, even though it's all from the same scan data."

        ],
        "answer": "C) An area of increased bone turnover, such as a fracture, infection, or metastasis.",
        "explanation": "Correct. A bone scan is a functional study that shows bone metabolism. The radiotracer (technetium-99m MDP) is taken up by osteoblasts in areas of high bone activity. Therefore, 'hot spots' (areas of increased uptake) are non-specific but indicate an underlying pathological process like a fracture, infection (osteomyelitis), or cancerous lesion."

        ],
        "answer": "A) Acquire nephrographic and excretory phase images simultaneously in a single scan.",
        "explanation": "Correct. A traditional CT urogram requires multiple scans, leading to a higher radiation dose. A split-bolus technique involves giving a portion of the contrast, waiting a few minutes for it to be excreted by the kidneys, then giving the rest of the bolus and scanning once. This clever timing allows the single scan to capture the kidneys enhancing (nephrographic phase) and the ureters filled with contrast (excretory phase) in one pass, significantly reducing the radiation dose."

        ],
        "answer": "C) An effect that has a threshold dose below which it is not observed, like skin erythema.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Radiation effects are divided into two types. Deterministic effects (e.g., skin burns, cataracts, hair loss) have a minimum threshold dose required to produce them, and the severity of the effect increases as the dose increases above that threshold.

        ],
        "answer": "B) The CTPA uses a much faster contrast injection and specific timing to see the pulmonary arteries.",
        "explanation": "Correct. While both are contrast-enhanced chest CTs, the protocol is very different. A standard chest CT is timed for general organ and mediastinal enhancement (venous phase). A CTPA (CT Pulmonary Angiogram) is a highly specialized study timed precisely to capture the peak density of contrast in the pulmonary arteries. Ordering the wrong test will likely miss the diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism."

        ],
        "answer": "C) To prevent motion artifact, which blurs the images.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Breathing causes the diaphragm and internal organs to move up and down. If the patient breathes during the scan, this movement causes significant blurring and streak artifacts on the reconstructed images, which can hide or mimic pathology. Holding the breath keeps the organs still, resulting in sharp, clear images."

        ],
        "answer": "B) The CT scan may appear completely normal in the aearly hours.",
        "explanation": "Correct. While a non-contrast CT is essential for ruling out a bleed, its primary limitation in ischemic stroke is its low sensitivity in the first few hours. The brain tissue may not have had enough time to develop cytotoxic edema and become visibly less dense (hypoattenuating). Early signs can be very subtle or absent."

        ],
        "answer": "C) To quickly and reliably rule out a hemorrhage.",
        "explanation": "Correct. The immediate management of acute stroke differs drastically for ischemic versus hemorrhagic types. Thrombolysis ('clot-busting' drugs) can be life-saving for an ischemic stroke but would be catastrophic in a patient with a hemorrhage. A non-contrast CT is extremely fast and sensitive for detecting acute blood, making it the essential first step to guide therapy."

        ],
        "answer": "B) To deliver IV contrast at a precise, rapid, and consistent flow rate.",
        "explanation": "Correct. A power injector is an essential piece of equipment for contrast-enhanced CT, particularly for angiography (CTA). It allows the technologist to inject IV contrast at a pre-programmed, high flow rate (e.g., 5 mL/sec) that is impossible to achieve by hand. This ensures that the contrast arrives in the target artery or organ at the perfect time for optimal imaging."

        ],
        "answer": "A) Both B and C are correct.",
        "explanation": "Correct. The scout image is a preliminary, low-dose radiograph (similar to a plain X-ray) that is taken before the main spiral CT acquisition. The technologist uses this image on their console to define the start and end points ('range') of the diagnostic scan and to ensure the patient is positioned correctly in the center of the gantry."

        ],
        "answer": "C) The 'Last Known Well' time.",
        "explanation": "Correct. The 'Last Known Well' time (or time of symptom onset) is the single most critical piece of clinical information because it determines the patient's eligibility for time-sensitive treatments like thrombolysis (typically within 4.5 hours) or thrombectomy. This information allows the radiology team to prioritize the scan and interpretation accordingly."

        ],
        "answer": "C) 'Query pneumonia, patient has fever and cough'.",
        "explanation": "Correct. This request is the most helpful because it provides a clear clinical question (pneumonia) and relevant symptoms (fever, cough). This allows the radiologist to tailor the scan protocol if needed (though a standard contrast CT is usual for this) and focus the diagnostic search pattern effectively, leading to a more accurate and relevant report."

        ],
        "answer": "B) A well-defined, sclerotic border.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Benign (slow-growing) bone lesions often have a sharp, thin, or thick 'sclerotic' (white) margin. This indicates that the bone has had sufficient time to react to the slow process and 'wall off' the lesion. In contrast, aggressive lesions grow too quickly for the bone to react, resulting in ill-defined borders and a wide zone of transition."

        ],
        "answer": "B) To better assess the three-dimensional nature of anatomy and the alignment of fractures.",
        "explanation": "Correct. An X-ray is a 2D projection of a 3D object. A single view can be misleading; it can hide the true displacement or angulation of a fracture, or misrepresent the location of a foreign body. Obtaining two views at 90 degrees (orthogonal) to each other is a fundamental principle of radiography that allows for a more accurate three-dimensional assessment."

The powerful magnetic field of an MRI scanner can damage the sensitive electronic components of a cochlear implant, potentially causing irreversible hearing loss or requiring surgical replacement. Most modern orthopaedic implants (like hip replacements) and vascular stents are MRI safe or conditional. While caution is used in pregnancy, it is not an absolute contraindication."

        ],
        "answer": "C) CT is much more sensitive and can see nearly all stone types and their exact location.",
        "explanation": "Correct. While a plain X-ray (KUB) can see many calcium-based stones, it can miss smaller stones or those that are not dense (e.g., uric acid stones). A non-contrast CT scan is the gold standard because it is extremely sensitive and can detect stones as small as 1mm, regardless of their composition. It also precisely pinpoints the stone's location in the ureter and can identify secondary signs like hydronephrosis."

        "explanation": "Correct. This is a critical patient safety check. For any female of childbearing age, it is crucial to assess the possibility of an early, unrecognized pregnancy to avoid inadvertent radiation exposure to a fetus. If pregnancy is possible, the radiologist and clinical team can discuss the risks and benefits and consider alternative, non-radiation imaging modalities like ultrasound or MRI."

        ],
        "answer": "B) Myeloma can cause renal failure, increasing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Multiple myeloma can lead to a specific type of renal impairment called 'myeloma kidney' due to the excretion of Bence-Jones proteins, which can damage the renal tubules. This pre-existing kidney damage puts the patient at a higher risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after receiving IV contrast.

        ],
        "answer": "C) They cause severe streak artifacts that can obscure anatomy.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Dense metal objects absorb the X-ray beam completely. This incomplete data causes the CT reconstruction software to produce prominent dark and light streaks across the image, known as streak artifact. These artifacts can completely obscure adjacent anatomical structures, rendering parts of the scan unreadable and potentially hiding pathology."

        ],
        "answer": "C) Oral contrast can obscure small stones in the ureters.",
        "explanation": "Correct. A CT KUB (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder) is a non-contrast study specifically designed to make dense kidney stones stand out against the soft tissues. Adding oral contrast would opacify the bowel loops. Since the bowel can lie directly over the ureters, the white contrast within the bowel could easily hide or obscure a small, white stone in the underlying ureter, defeating the purpose of the scan."

        ],
        "answer": "B) To evaluate structures that enhance differently at different times, like the liver.",
        "explanation": "Correct. Multi-phase imaging is a specific diagnostic tool used to characterize certain pathologies. Different tissues and tumors have unique blood supplies. For example, some liver tumors (like hepatocellular carcinoma) are hypervascular and are most conspicuous on the arterial phase, while others (like metastases) are best seen on the later venous phase.

        "explanation": "Correct. Adequate timing is crucial for achieving good opacification of the gastrointestinal tract with oral contrast. A longer delay (typically 60-90 minutes) is necessary to allow the contrast to travel from the stomach through the entire length of the small bowel and into the colon. This is essential for accurately evaluating conditions like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or an abscess."
